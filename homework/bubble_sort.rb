# Challenge 1: Without Custom Classes
#
# Write an implementation of bubble sort that does not use any custom classes. You'll likely want to use methods and will surely needs arrays and a while loop.
#
# In addition to writing an implementation following the template below, answer the following questions:
#
# Given the numbers 0 through 5, what would be the worst case scenario for bubble sort (aka, what order would necessitate the most swaps)?
# How many swaps would that worst case take?
# The example above took 21 iterations to get to a result. Can you tweak the algorithm so that it takes the same
# number of swaps (7) but fewer total operations?
