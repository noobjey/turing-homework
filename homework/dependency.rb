# Part 2: Experimenting with Dependencies
#
# Read a part of Chapter 3, pages 35 through 42 up to "Isolate Dependencies".
#
#Then, let's do an experiment with dependency injection. Check out this usage:
#
# screen_printer = ScreenPrinter.new
# fibber = Fibber.new(screen_printer)
# fibber.print(10) # => prints the first 10 numbers of the fibonacci sequence to
#                  #    the screen separated by a single space
# file_printer = FilePrinter.new("output.txt")
# fibber = Fibber.new(file_printer)
# fibber.print(10) # => prints the first 10 number of the fibonacci sequence to
#                  #    a file named 'output.txt' separated by a single space
# Build Fibber, ScreenPrinter, and FilePrinter classes to make that work.
